# Loan-Lending

In this project, we're going to be exploring some real-world data
that was publicly available from Lending Club. If you ever heard of it, Lending Club connects
people who need money known as borrowers with people who have money known as investors.
And hopefully, as an investor, you're going to want to invest in people who show a profile of having a
high probability of paying you back.
And we're going to try to create a model to help predict this using **Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms**

Lending Club as a company had a very interesting year in 2016. There was some scandal and fraud involved there.
We're going to do is check out some of the data. It's from the year 2007 to 2010.
