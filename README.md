# Loan-Lending

In this project, we're going to explore some real-world data
that was publicly available from Lending Club. 

Lending Club connects
people who need money known as borrowers with people who have money known as investors.
And hopefully, as an investor, you will invest in people who show a profile of having a
high probability of paying you back.

So, we're going to create a model to help predict this using **Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms**

Lending Club as a company had a very interesting year in 2016. There was some scandal and fraud involved there.
We will check out some of the data and try to solve the problem. It's from the year 2007 to 2010.
